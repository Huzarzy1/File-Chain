# File-Chain easy file transfer 

File-Chain is a Python-built GUI application that takes files subitted submitted from the senders device, stores them a python flask server (I use a Raspberry Pi), and can be recieved and downloaded on to the recipient's device. This allows for easy file sharing between devices whether they are photos, school work, or even code snippets. I personally compiled the client file to have an executable on my desktop for anytime use. All you have to do is attach the IP address of your Pi, run the server, and boom.
